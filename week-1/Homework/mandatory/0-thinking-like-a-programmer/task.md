# Tasks

## 1. Install ESLint

Using ESLint can make debugging a lot easier. If you haven't already you should install it now.

## 2. Thinking like a Programmer

During these past weeks you have gotten a taste of what programming is: the various concepts, what it looks like in code and the way it's used. However, having written some code doesn't make you a programmer. Thinking like a programmer makes you into a programmer. But what does that mean, 'thinking like a programmer'?

Thinking like a programmer is very similar to thinking like a construction worker:

You have to build something and it's up to you to know all the necessary tools and techniques to make that happen, and
You have to solve every problem that comes up along the way (such as things that go wrong, knowing how to choose the right tools for the job and striving to achieve the right goal)
The second skill, problem solving, is the most important one. If you get good at that, you'll automatically get good at the first.

Take a look at the following resources to learn more about problem solving as applied to programming:

After you've watched these videos I'd like you to answer these questions

## 1. What do you think the most important quality for a programmer is?

<!-- Write your answer here -->
The most important quality for a programmer is to be a good problem solver. In fact, everything a programmer does is about finding solution for a problem sets. So, it is outmost importance for a programmer to be a problem solving. To be a good problem solver you need to have a problem solving framework.

## 2. When trying to solve a challenge, what should you do first?

<!-- Write your answer here -->

Each programmer might have a different problem solving framework, however the first step of problem solving is understanding the problem. Usually we tend to jump into the problem begin solving. But, without understanding the problem and its foundation, we might loose a lot of time if we jump into solving right away. We need to keep time for understanding firstly. 

## 3. What should you do if you get stuck?

<!-- Write your answer here -->

It is very common to get stuck during a programing problem. If we have a standing problem solving framework, it is no problem. We can deal with that. If we stuck during problem solving, one way yo continue is debugging. A programmer must have skills in debugging and handling error and program faults.
